## Requirements
MonoGame is requiered for the client.

To install it on Windows, run in terminal: `dotnet new install MonoGame.Templates.CSharp`

If you are using Visual Studio, you can install the extension: `MonoGame Framework C# project templates`

Make sure the MGCB Editor is installed. Without it, you will have to edit the .MGCB file manually to add new content such as images and music.
